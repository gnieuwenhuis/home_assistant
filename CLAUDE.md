# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A **Home Assistant configuration** for a two-room space (office + studio), versioned in git. The goal is to mirror the live HA configuration here, with the exceptions called out below.

Tracked:

- `configuration.yaml` — root HA config, template sensors, `neviweb130` integration, notify group
- `automations.yaml` — all automations (HVAC controllers, backup heat, humidity)
- `scripts.yaml`, `scenes.yaml` — included from `configuration.yaml`; currently empty
- `custom_templates/setpoint.jinja` — the heat-pump setpoint macro
- `custom_templates/changeover.jinja` — changeover advisor decision macros
- `tests/`, `pytest.ini`, `requirements-dev.txt` — pytest harness (see "Tests")
- `helpers.yaml` — `input_number` / `input_boolean` / `input_select` definitions; **not yet wired** into `configuration.yaml` (see "Helpers migration" below)
- `secrets.yaml.example` — placeholder showing which `!secret` keys must exist

Not tracked (in `.gitignore`):

- `secrets.yaml` — real credentials. Commit only the `.example`.
- `home-assistant.log*`, `home-assistant_v2.db*`, `.HA_VERSION`, `.uuid`, `deps/`, `tts/`, `image/`, `.cloud/` — HA runtime artifacts
- `.storage/` — HA's internal state store; rewritten constantly, and `.storage/auth*` holds tokens

External entities that automations reference but that are defined elsewhere (Zigbee integrations, weather integrations, mobile companion app): `sensor.lethbridge_temperature`, `weather.lethbridge` (EC weather entity used by `sensor.changeover_balance`), `sensor.office_temperature`, `sensor.studio_temperature`, `sensor.tz3000_utwgoauk_snzb_02_humidity`, `mobile_app_pixel_8`. Don't assume an entity is undefined just because it isn't grep-able locally.

## Tests

`pytest` covers the changeover logic: Level 2 tests render the
`custom_templates/*.jinja` macros against a real HA template engine
(`pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`); Level 3 tests load the changeover
automations and the changeover-balance template sensor **from the real YAML
files** and exercise triggers/conditions/actions with mocked services.

```sh
uv python install 3.14                       # once; HA 2026.6 needs Python ≥ 3.14
uv venv .venv --python 3.14
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # keep pinned to the live HA version
.venv/bin/pytest
```

There is no other build / lint pipeline. Changes are deployed by syncing these
files to the HA instance and reloading the relevant domain (automations,
template entities) from the HA UI or via `homeassistant.reload_*` services.

## Custom integrations (HACS)

Not vendored into this repo. If restoring from scratch, install HACS first, then add:

- **claudegel/sinope-130** (integration) → `custom_components/neviweb130` — Sinopé Wi-Fi baseboard heaters; referenced by the `neviweb130:` block in `configuration.yaml`
- **bodyscape/cielo_home** (integration) → `custom_components/cielo_home` — Cielo Home Wi-Fi controller for the heat pumps; provides `climate.office` / `climate.studio`, `switch.office_power` / `switch.studio_power`, and `sensor.office_target_temperature` / `sensor.studio_target_temperature`
- **RomRider/apexcharts-card** (Lovelace plugin) → `www/community/apexcharts-card` — used by the dashboards

## Helpers migration

`helpers.yaml` is committed with values copied verbatim from `.storage/` on the host, but is **not yet included** from `configuration.yaml` because the same helpers are still defined in the UI. To switch over, follow the migration steps at the top of `helpers.yaml`: delete the UI-defined helpers, add three `!include` lines to `configuration.yaml`, then reload from Developer Tools.

Once that's done, `helpers.yaml` becomes the source of truth — edit there, not in the UI.

## Architecture

### Two rooms, two device pairs per room

Each room has:

1. A **Sinopé Wi-Fi baseboard heater** via the `neviweb130` integration — `climate.neviweb130_climate_th1123wf` (office) / `th1124wf` (studio). Provides `current_temperature`, `hourly_kwh`, and in cold-weather backup mode actually does the heating.
2. A **heat pump** (mini-split) controlled via the `cielo_home` HACS integration. Each unit exposes both a `climate` entity (`climate.office`, `climate.studio`) and a power `switch` (`switch.office_power`, `switch.studio_power`) — same physical device, two entities. The HVAC controllers reference these by entity name (`climate.office` / `climate.studio` for the climate side; `switch.office_power` / `switch.studio_power` for the power switch).

Independent of the rooms: dehumidifier plug `ab8b624cc66726276f8c0a35c7903c9f` and humidifier plug `60211ed7b46e92fd6dcadf60d8087fd0` share one Zigbee humidity sensor.

### The two-stage heat-pump control loop

The heat pump's target temperature isn't the user's preferred room temperature — it's a *steering* value computed from how far the room is from preferred. The loop has two stages:

1. **Setpoint computation** (`custom_templates/setpoint.jinja`, exposed as `sensor.<room>_heat_pump_setpoint_temperature` in `configuration.yaml`)
   `setpoint = base_temp − (current_temp − preferred) × 1.25`, clamped to `[17, 30]` °C. `base_temp` comes from a secondary indoor temperature sensor (`sensor.<room>_temperature`); `current_temp` comes from the baseboard heater's built-in thermometer. The room temperature error pushes the setpoint *away* from preferred to make the pump work harder. Rounding is direction-aware: rounds up when the room is too cold, down when too warm. In backup-heat mode the setpoint collapses to `base_temp − 1`.

2. **Apply / gate** (HVAC controllers, event-driven)
   Each room's controller fires on state changes to its setpoint sensor, preferred, swing, or mode (with a 2-minute debounce on mode flapping), plus a 5-minute safety heartbeat. It reads desired state (`desired_on`, `desired_hvac`, `setpoint`) and current state (`switch.<room>_power`'s on/off, `climate.<room>`'s hvac_mode and target temperature), and acts only on real deltas — so every Cielo API call is justified. The controller short-circuits when any critical sensor, switch, or climate entity is `unavailable` or `unknown`, to avoid spurious writes.

The dead band (`swing` = `input_number.<room>_temp_range`) prevents thrash: inside `[preferred − swing, preferred + swing]`, neither `desired_on` nor `desired_off` is true, so no Cielo call is issued.

### Backup heat mode

When `sensor.lethbridge_temperature < −12 °C` for 20 minutes, `input_boolean.backup_heat` turns on, both baseboards are pushed to each room's `preferred` temperature, and the setpoint macro collapses (so the HVAC controllers stop driving the heat pumps hard). On warmup, baseboards are dropped to `preferred − 2.5 °C` so the heat pump leads again. The −2.5 °C offset is what lets the heat pump take primary duty without the baseboard fighting it — don't remove it casually.

### Changeover advisor (suggest + confirm)

`heat_pump_mode` is never switched autonomously. `sensor.changeover_balance`
(hourly) integrates the next 48 h of Environment Canada hourly forecast into
heating/cooling degree-hours around `input_number.changeover_balance_point`
(~16 °C); outside `±input_number.changeover_deadband` it nominates
heating/cooling, inside it nominates off (open windows) — so the outdoor
gates (no AC when cold out, no heat when warm out) fall out of the math.

A nomination only becomes a Pixel 8 actionable notification
(`heat_pump_mode_advisor`) when a room confirms the demand **with a
duty-cycle alibi**: indoor temperature is a regulated variable, so a room's
smoothed mean (`sensor.<room>_temperature_<1h|2h>_mean`) only counts as
evidence when that room's pump was idle (`sensor.<room>_heat_pump_duty_24h`
< 2 %) — otherwise the pump itself may be the cause (the office head is
oversized for its small room and overshoots, hence its longer 2 h window).

`timer.changeover_hold` blocks suggestions while active: started for 12 h on
every suggestion (nag floor) and 24 h on every mode change
(`heat_pump_mode_changed`, which also powers down both heads when entering
`off`). Decision logic lives in `custom_templates/changeover.jinja` as pure
macros — tested in `tests/`, shared by the sensor and the advisor.

### Humidity (independent of HVAC)

A single state-driven controller (`studio_humidity_controller` in `automations.yaml`)
reconciles the dehumidifier plug (`switch.mini_plug_4_socket_1`) and humidifier plug
(`switch.studio_humidifier_socket_1`) from the current reading of the shared Zigbee humidity
sensor — the same reconcile-on-delta pattern as the HVAC controllers. It replaced four
edge-triggered on/off automations that could strand a device (and run both at once) when a
threshold crossing was missed.

Asymmetric hysteresis around `input_number.humidity_set_point` with
`input_number.humidity_tolerance`:

- Dehumidifier: wants on when humidity `≥ set_point + tolerance`, off when `< set_point`
- Humidifier: wants on when humidity `≤ set_point − tolerance`, off when `> set_point`
- Inside `[set_point − tolerance, set_point + tolerance]` each device holds its last state —
  the intentional dead band.

Three invariants are enforced by construction:

- **Never both on.** Turn-on branches require the opposite device to be off; a mutual-exclusion
  safety branch turns off the wrong device (humidity decides) if both are ever on.
- **Relaxation cooldown.** Any controller turn-off starts `timer.humidity_cooldown` (15 min);
  turn-ons are blocked while it runs, so an overshoot can't immediately trip the opposite
  device. The controller is `mode: single` so its own switch events don't restart it mid-run;
  the deferred turn-on is driven by the `timer.finished` trigger and the 5-min heartbeat.
- **Respect manual flips.** `studio_humidity_manual_detector` compares each switch change
  against an `input_boolean.<device>_intended` mirror (set by the controller before it
  commands) to tell manual changes apart from controller ones, and arms a 15-min
  `timer.<device>_manual_grace`; the controller leaves a switch alone while its grace timer is
  active (except the both-on safety).

The new helpers (`input_boolean.dehumidifier_intended`, `input_boolean.humidifier_intended`,
and the three `timer.*` entities) follow the same "UI-defined now, mirrored in `helpers.yaml`
for the eventual migration" status as the other helpers. The changeover advisor adds four more
in the same status: `input_number.changeover_balance_point`, `input_number.changeover_deadband`,
`timer.changeover_hold`, and the `"off"` option on `input_select.heat_pump_mode`.

## Conventions

- Per-room entity names follow `<sensor|input_number|...>.<room>_<thing>`: `sensor.<room>_baseboard_current_temperature`, `sensor.<room>_heat_pump_setpoint_temperature`, `input_number.<room>_preferred_temperature`, `input_number.<room>_temp_range`. Stay on this pattern when adding entities.
- The thematic banner comments in `automations.yaml` (`# HVAC controllers`, `# Backup heat`, `# Humidity`) are the file's structure — keep them and group new automations under the right one.
- Automations created in the HA UI get a numeric id (`'1765126659858'`); hand-written ones get descriptive ids (`office_hvac_controller`). Both are valid — match whichever style the section already uses.
